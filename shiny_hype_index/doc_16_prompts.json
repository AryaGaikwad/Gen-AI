  "What are the three general approaches to addressing the problem of large language models not having the necessary information to answer a user's question?",
  "What is the core concept of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in the context of providing additional context to a large language model?",
  "What are the two main factors that determine similarity when implementing RAG for a user query?",
  "Which embedding model is used in the basic example for implementing RAG, and why is it chosen?",
  "How can a user scale up the basic RAG example to better match their use case, in terms of embedding model, similarity metric, and document storage/retrieval efficiency?"
